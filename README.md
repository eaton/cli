# Eaton's CLI Tools

A big ol' bundle of stuff I use together when making CLIs for node.js projects. Most of these are geared towards adding a little extra polish to simple NPM scripts, rather than full-fledged OCLIF style CLI frameworks. Easy to add, easy to use, easy to ignore in favor of the stuff I'm actually trying to get done.
